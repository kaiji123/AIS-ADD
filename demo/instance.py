# Next, we'll import the necessary modules

from torchvision.models.detection.mask_rcnn import MaskRCNN
import torchvision.models as models
# Create an instance of the ResNet-50 backbone model
backbone = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# We can create a Mask R-CNN model by specifying the number of classes and the pretrained weights to use:
num_classes = 2  # You would need to specify the number of classes in your dataset
model = MaskRCNN(num_classes=num_classes,backbone=backbone, pretrained=True)

# If you have a GPU available, you can use it to accelerate the model by moving it to the GPU:
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    model = model.cuda()

# Now let's define some example data to use for inference:
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 800, 800)  # this should be a tensor representing your image
targets = [{'boxes': torch.tensor([[100, 100, 200, 200]]),
            'labels': torch.tensor([1]),
            'masks': torch.tensor([[[0, 0, 1, 1]]])}]  # this should be a list of dictionaries representing your ground truth data

# Now we can use the model to predict instance masks for the image:
predictions = model([image], [targets])

# The predictions variable will be a list of dictionaries containing the following keys:
# - "boxes": the predicted bounding box coordinates of the objects
# - "labels": the predicted class labels of the objects
# - "scores": the confidence of the object detections
# - "masks": a binary mask indicating the pixels belonging to the objects
